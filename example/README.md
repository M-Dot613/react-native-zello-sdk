# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) instructions before proceeding.

## Install Dependencies

```
# Navigate to the project root
cd ..
npm install
# OR using Yarn
# yarn install
cd example
npm install
```

## Start the Metro Server

To start Metro, run the following command from the `example` folder:

```bash
npm start
```

## Start the Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal. Run the following command to start the _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

Install the dependencies:

```bash
cd ios
pod install

# OR using npm
npx pod-install
```

You will need to change the Code Signing team to your own team. Additionally, you may need to setup your own App Groups + Keychain Sharing values.

Please note that if you want the example app to work in the background, you will need to setup an APNS key, and email us at sdk@zello.com. Lastly, you'll need to modify the App Group value in [this file](https://github.com/zelloptt/react-native-zello-sdk/blob/develop/example/ios/NotificationServiceExtension/NotificationService.swift).

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run the app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

# Troubleshooting

If you can't get this to work, see the [Troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting) page.
